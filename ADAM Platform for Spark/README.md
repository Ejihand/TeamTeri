# ADAM Genomics Analysis Platform for Spark

* [ADAM](http://bdgenomics.org/) is a genomics analysis platform with specialized file formats built using Apache Avro, Apache Spark and Parquet. Apache 2 licensed. The latest version uses Scala.
* GitHub Repo is [here](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam) - this tool is being built by a team at the [AMPLamp](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/) at UC Berkeley and other universities
* Of note is their 'cleaning tool' named [SampleClean](http://sampleclean.org/index.html)
* Simple Clean uses algorithms, stats and AWS Mechanical Turks to pre-process data
* Here is a DataBricks [Scala Notebook](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/438089/notebooks/Samples/Miscellaneous/Genome_Variant_Analysis_using_k-means_ADAM_and_Apache_Spark.html) which demos Genome Variant Analysis using k-means, ADAM, and Apache Spark
* Here is diagram of their 'Big Data Stack'
