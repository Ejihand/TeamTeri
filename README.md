# Team Teri

This Repo contains my own study notes for 'Understanding bioinformatics concepts for cloud professionals' - including...

* **Bioinformatics** : frameworks, tools and libraries such as GATK, VariantSpark, Galaxy, ADAM and others, also workflow platforms such as Terra.bio
* **Public Cloud** : services from either GCP (Google Cloud Platform) or AWS (Amazon Web Services), usually implemented via a **Data Lake** pattern (shown below)
* **Practices** : industry patterns and practices for scalable data pipelines including serverless

## How this Repo is Organized

This Repo is my own 'study notes' as I learn tools, platforms and work with clients.  I update it frequently.  The Repo is organized as follows.  
- **Genomic Tools** (GATK, VariantSpark, HAIL and many more - this section updates OFTEN)
- **Genomics Platforms** (Terra.bio, Galaxy Project, IDSeq and others)
- **Lab Testing** (Illumina and more)
- **Public Cloud Genomics** (AWS, Azure or GCP)
- **Genomics Whitepapers** (anything I am reading of interest, some 'future-looking' whitepapers)

## Who is Teri?

Teri is the impetus for my movement into the world of genomic research.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016.  She survived, but suffered a long course of intense and painful treatment due in part to the lack of availability of personalized treatment options at the time of her diagnosis.
