## How this Repo is Organized

This Repo contains my own 'study notes' as I learn genomic-scale cloud bioinformatics.  It includes descriptions of common tools, platforms and summarieis of my work with clients.  I update this Repo frequently.  It is organized via the folder structure shown below.   
 
- **Concepts and Terms** (genomics files types, use cases, terminology and also whitepapers)
- **Lab Testing** (Illumina and more)
- **Genomic Tools** (GATK, VariantSpark, HAIL and many more - this section updates OFTEN)
- **Genomics Platforms** (Terra.bio, Galaxy Project, IDSeq and others)
- **Public Cloud Genomics** (Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Azure or GCP). The general approach is to implement a cloud-native Data Lake pattern for scalable genomic analysis.  A conceptual rendering of this pattern is shown below.

## More Cloud/Genomics Reources

In addition to this Repo, I have a number of other Repos with cloud bioinformatics information.  Also, I've included two of my favorite link aggregator resources here for additional learning.  

- :octocat: my `learn-cloud` Repo - https://github.com/lynnlangit/learning-cloud
- :octocat: my `gcp-for-bioinformatics` open source course - https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics
- :octocat: my `learn-wdl` open source course - https://github.com/openwdl/learn-wdl
- :octocat: a link Collection : [link to Repo (awesome bioinformatics)](https://github.com/openbiox/awosome-bioinformatics) with large number of curated links for learning about bioinformatics tools and topics
- :book: Bioinformatics Workbook: [link to online course with key bioinformatics concepts](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/)

## Who is Teri?

Teri is the impetus for my movement into the world of genomic research.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016.  She survived, but suffered a long course of intense and painful treatment due in part to the lack of availability of personalized treatment options at the time of her diagnosis.
