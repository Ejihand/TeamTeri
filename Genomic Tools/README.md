# Genomic Tools and Registries

There are a growing number of (mostly open source) genomic analysis tools available.  In addition, there are genomic tool registries which help with discovery of such tools.  These include GATK, HAIL, ADAM, Bioconductor, IDSeq, VariantSpark and more.

## Registries

- Biocontainers - tool containers (images hosted on DockerHub, Quay.io or other public container registry)
- Dockstore - Genomic workflows - in CWL, NF or WDL (hosted in GitHub) and associated container-based tools
- Galaxy Toolshed - tools for Galaxy Project workflows (.ga files)
- nf-core - Nextflow workflows (.nf files)
- bioconda - Bioconda is a channel for the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics software

## Blast 10 Ways

I wrote a short article on Medium using the `blast` tool, which demonstrates my approach to testing genomics tools - [link](https://medium.com/@lynnlangit/blast-10-ways-3db78f881059)
