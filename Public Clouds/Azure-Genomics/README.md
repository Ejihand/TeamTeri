## About Microsoft Genomics

Using Azure Batch, standard tools (such as GATK), Microsoft adds their genomics client (`msgen`) for genomics workloads.  

- The Microsoft Genomics client (`msgen`) is a Python front-end to the web service, architecture shown below
- It can beinstalled like a standard Python package, on Windows or Linux via `pip install msgen`
- For each genome sample that you want to process, you create a configuration file containing all the parameters
