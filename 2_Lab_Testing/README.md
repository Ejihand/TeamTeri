# Genomic Sequencing

There are a LARGE number of types of sequencing.  Start with wikipedia  
- DNA Sequencing - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing
- RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq

## Background and Illumina

- The main Illumina website includes useful information as well - https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/beginners.html
- Algorithms for [DNA Sequencing (YouTube series)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2mpR0RYFQsBiCWVJSvVAO3OJ2t7DzoHA) - by Ben Langmead - partial list shown below
- From this series, particularly useful is the summary of sequencing - ['Sequencing by Synthesis'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzXQVwWYFv4)
