1. Get Data
    Upload data into Galaxy (main and variant)
        from UCSC Main table browser
2. Analyze Data
    Operate on Genomic Intervals
        Join exons w/SNPs
    Join, Subtract and Group
        Count SNPs per exon
    Filter/Sort
        Sort exons by SNP count
    Manipulation/Select First
        Select top 5 exons with highest SNP count
    Join, Subtract and Group
        Recover exon detail for data display
3. Extract as Galaxy Workflow (optional0
    Can also annotate/save as history
4. Edit Workflow 
    Flag workflow outputs (hides intermediate steps)
    Rename inputs for readability
    Set desired parameters at runtime in workflow
5. Run updated workflow on entire genome
    Get/import datasets
    Start the workflow
