The Nextflow platform architecture is shown in the slide above.

## About the Nextflow platform 
NF is built by Seqera Labs. NF pipelines can run on AWS, Azure, GCP and other environments

## Example Pipeline

Nextflow allows you to build, configure and run data-driven computational pipelines, an example is shown below.  Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. The example diagram is for the [nf-core/eager](https://nf-co.re/eager) pipeline. This pipeline is a scalable and reproducible bioinformatics best-practise processing pipeline for genomic NGS sequencing data, with a focus on ancient DNA (aDNA) data. It is ideal for the (palaeo)genomic analysis of humans, animals, plants, microbes and even microbiomes

## Cloud Based Execution

### AWS

Conceptual architecture for running Nextflow pipeline on AWS is shown above, note that the use of AWS FsxLustre is not required, it's one of several file storage options available when building pipelines.
- More detailed sample architecture for NF on AWS is shown below.

### Azure 

Nextflow allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages.  Its fluent DSL simplifies the implementation and the deployment of complex parallel and reactive workflows on clouds and clusters.  The general pattern for deploying a Nextflow pipeline on a public cloud (VM batch) service is shown below.
