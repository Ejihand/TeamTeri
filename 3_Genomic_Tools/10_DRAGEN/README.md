# Illumina DRAGEN

From the Illumina documentation - [link](https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/software_documentation/dragen-bio-it/Illumina-DRAGEN-Bio-IT-Platform-User-Guide-1000000141465-00.pdf)

The Illumina DRAGEN™ Bio-IT Platform is based on the highly reconfigurable DRAGEN Bio-IT Processor,
which is integrated on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) card and is available in a preconfigured
server that can be seamlessly integrated into bioinformatics workflows. The platform can be loaded
with highly optimized algorithms for many different NGS secondary analysis pipelines, including the
following:

• Whole genome
• Exome
• RNA-Seq
• Methylome
• Cancer

All interaction is accomplished via DRAGEN software that runs on the host server and manages all
communication with the DRAGEN board.
