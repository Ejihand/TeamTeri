# GATK

![GATK Overview](https://github.com/lynnlangit/TeamTeri/blob/master/Images/GATK-1.png)

The open source [GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) contains common genomics tools.  These tools are used for identifying SNPs and indels in germline DNA and RNAseq data. GATK also includes somatic variant calling tools, for copy number (CNV) and structural variation (SV). GATK is created and maintained by The Broad Institute.  GATK is available as a [downloadble JAR file](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases) or in a [Docker container.](https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/gatk/)

## Using GATK Tools

Shown below is task-by-task usage for tools from the  GATK tools used in an example genomic analysis process  
![GATK Process](https://github.com/lynnlangit/TeamTeri/blob/master/Images/GATK-deep.png).

- UNDERSTAND how to use GATK - (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us)
- START using GATK - (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360036194592-Getting-started-with-GATK4)
- RUN GATK best practices workflows/pipelines (https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035894751-Pipeline-Index)

## GATK running on the Broad Institute Cloud Platforms

- GATK tools are available to run on GCP via the Broad Institute's 'Terra.bio' platform(https://terra.bio/)
- [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/) evolved from the [Firecloud platform](https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/)
- A Terra.bio platform architecture summary is shown in the screenshot below

### Book GITC

- To learn more, I suggest reading the book ['Genomics in the Cloud'](https://www.amazon.com/Genomics-Cloud-GATK-Spark-Docker/dp/1491975199)
  - One of the authors (Geraldine) wrote a book [chapter synopsis on twitter](https://twitter.com/VdaGeraldine/status/1263336914859560962?s=20)
  - Associated GitHub code Repo for this book includes [WDL examples](https://github.com/broadinstitute/genomics-in-the-cloud)


### Book Club GITC

- There is also an associated book club, run by [KT Picard](https://genomedad.com/2020/12/15/genomics-in-the-cloud-book-club/)
- The book club has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdwGKTSsRQZgAO6D79lSPA)
- The book club also has a [Slack channel](https://gitcbookclub.slack.com/).
